 * sink ends up with Front Left, Front Right, Rear Left, Rear Right.
 * However, AC3 calls the rear channels "side". If the AC3 mapping
 * is used, no audio will come from the rear channels.
 * So, when this is undefined, the AC3 "side" channels get mapped
 * to the sink "rear" channels.
 * I don't think this should ever be defined, but it's here just
